This repo holds the demo for HUST material cloud database, based on Django3, Vue3 and tailwind css.

## Prepare the environment

To run the website, you should download the project source code, and prepare the environment for both frontend and backend:

- Download the repo source code and unzip it, you should see *frontend* and *backend* folder under the project root folder.
- For frontend: First run `cd frontend`; then run `npm install`.
- For backend: Back to the project root folder, first run `cd backend`; then run `python install -r requirements.txt`.

Now you should be set with the environment containing all dependencies.

## Run the website.

As you should be prepared by now, running the website is an easy task:

- Back to the root folder: First run `cd backend`; then run `python manage.py runserver`.
- Back to the root folder: First run `cd frontend`; then run `npm run dev`.

You can check the frontend logging console to see the address of this website. By default, it's at *http://127.0.0.1:3000*
